## Synopsis
**Note! This post is a addition to [Create blog posts from RStudio to WordPress](http://www.networkx.nl/programming/create-blog-posts-from-rstudio-to-wordpress-39/)**

About a week ago I tried to add my blog to [R-Bloggers](http://www.r-bloggers.com/). I thought everything was correct to add it. But this week I got a mail from [Tal Galili](http://www.r-statistics.com/about/) (site administrator of R-Bloggers) with the message that my blog uses base64 images in my feed. 

This type of images are created, as default option, with knitr as a standalone HTML document. It would be great if I could solve it with PNG instead of base64 images, even better if I could solve it with posting from RStudio to WordPress.

And so I did. In this post I will explain you how to post your WordPress post with PNG files and upload it to your blog.

## How to recognize a base64 image 
Well you can check your RSS feed of your blog and search for `data:image/png;base64`, it should be something like this (thx Tal for the image :)):

## Setting your options
To upload your PNG files to your blog you need to set some knitr options first.

As I described in my earlier post you had to set your login parameters to login to your WordPress blog. For the upload of files to WordPress you need to set the `upload.fun` option of `knitr`. This will take the filename as the input and returns a link to the image in the RMarkdown file.

Let's set the login parameters and the upload.fun options. I've hashed it out because I can not post to the dummy credentials. In the earlier [post](http://www.networkx.nl/programming/create-blog-posts-from-rstudio-to-wordpress-39/) you can add the upload.fun option after your login credentials and you are good to go.
```{r}
# Load libraries
#library(RWordPress)
#library(knitr)

# Login parameters
#options(WordpressLogin=c(your_username="your_password"),
#        WordpressURL="http://your.blog.com/xmlrpc.php")

# Upload your plots as png files to your blog
#opts_knit$set(upload.fun = function(file){library(RWordPress);uploadFile(file)$url;})
```

After setting the above credentials your are ready to upload your post with PNG image(s) to your blog. For the completeness I will post a png image in this post I will create within R.

## Example of posting your PNG image
```{r label = iris}
data(iris)
pairs(iris, col = iris$Species)
```

After this I could start post to my blog with `knit2wpCrayon`.

```{r}
#knit2wpCrayon("r2blog_with_png.Rmd", 
#        title = "Upload plots as PNG file to your wordpress",
#        categories = c("R", "Programming"), 
#        publish = FALSE, upload = TRUE)
```
 Again I hashed it because it could not post itself.
 
 This code can also be find on my [GitHub](https://github.com/jletteboer/networkx.nl/tree/master/r2blog).
